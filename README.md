## Stroop Effect:

The Stroop effect is a psychological phenomenon that occurs when there is a delay in reaction time between congruent and incongruent stimuli.  It's most commonly observed when someone has difficulty naming the color of ink when it's used to spell the name of a different color. For example, it's easier to recognize the color of the word "BLUE" when it's written in blue, but more difficult when it's written in red.

## Using the Program:

There are two versions of the experiment. The `fontcolor` file tests the subject's reaction time to incongruent color and language stimulus. The `wordname` file is a control to test the subjects reaction time to recognizing the word. To change the current experiment being run, change the file name in line 464 of `stroop-task-experiment.py`.
